							We want to ensure that people can experience all the awe-inspiring wildlife our planet has

							conserving habitats, preserving natural resources and protecting species.
						</p>
						<p class="postulates__paragraph _anim-items _anim-no-hide blue">
							In our view, we should all strive to preserve and regenerate the places we visit. From
							eliminating single-use plastics, to finding new, more effective ways to reduce and offset
							carbon emissions – it all adds up doing good while we travel.
						</p>
						<p class="postulates__paragraph _anim-items _anim-no-hide pink">
							By expanding travel’s economic benefits, alleviating overcrowding and filtering tourism
							through to less-visited areas, we believe that travel’s exponential growth can be a positive
							force. Tourism should empower local communities, allowing hosts to capitalise on, and
							protect, their natural and cultural resources.
						</p>
						<p class="postulates__paragraph _anim-items _anim-no-hide gray">
							We know that reducing the environmental impact of transport and aviation is key to reducing
							the travel industry’s overall footprint. Collectively, the industry must work towards a
							range of measures, from emissions reporting and investment in new technology, to aligning on
							policy change.
